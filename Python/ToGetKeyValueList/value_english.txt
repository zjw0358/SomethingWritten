The birthday of Guru Gobind Singh ji, who played a monumental part in the development of the Sikh faith. He created a warrior brotherhood that evolve Sikhism as a disciplined and determined religion.
Lohri marks the culmination of winter. People gather round the bonfires, throw sweets, puffed rice and popcorn into the flames, sing popular songs and exchange greetings.
This festival is celebrated by taking dips in the Ganga or any river and offering water to the Sun God. The dip is said to purify the self and bestow punya. Special Puja is offered as a thanksgiving for good harvest.
Baisakhi is a long established harvest festival in Punjab that also has religious significance. Baisakhi is one of the holiest days in Sikhism, commemorating Khalsa.
This is a festival celebrating Saraswati, the Goddess of knowledge, music and art. During this festival children are taught their first words and brahmins are fed.
Mahashivratri is celebrated on the 6th night of the dark Phalgun every year. It is believed that on this day Lord Shiva was married to Devi Parvati. On this auspicious day, devotees observe fast, keep vigil all night and offer fruits, flowers and bel leaves on Shiva Linga.
This festival takes place on the eve of Holi. The day is also popularly called 'Chhoti Holi' or the 'Small Holi'. The bigger event of playing with the colour takes place on the next day.
This is a popular spring festival, observed in India, also called the Festival of Colours. People spend the day throwing coloured powder and water at each other.
Indian calendar new year beginning.
It celebrates the love of a brother for his sister. On this day, sisters tie Rakhi on the wrists of their brothers to protect them against evil influences.
Lord Vishnu is invoked in his human incarnation as Krishna on his birth anniversary. The temples of Vrindavan witness a colourful celebration on this occasion.
The culmination of the Navratra festival is Maha Navmi when the Goddess Durga is worshipped as Aparajita. This is the concluding day of Durga Puja. The main Navmi Puja begins after the end of Sandhi Puja. The Navmi Bhog is offered to the Goddess. This is later partaken as prasad by the devotees.
The famous festival of Dashehra or Vijaya Dashami comes after the nine days of Navaratra. On this day Lord Rama had killed Ravana, signifying the victory of good over evil. Massive effigies of Ravana, his younger brother Kumbhakarna and son Meghanatha are erected, stuffed with fire-crackers and set aflame.
Vikrami

Ram Navmi
Ganesh Chaturthi
Ram Navmi falls on the ninth day of the Hindu lunar year and celebrated as the birthday of Shri Ram. Lord Ram was the seventh incarnation of Lord Vishnu, who takes birth on earth when Adharma over rules Dharma. Lord Ram was born on earth to destroy the demon named Ravan. On this day, Hindus do fast or restrict themselves to a specific diet and perform worship. Temples are decorated and readings of the Ramayana take place. Along with Shri Ram, people also worship Sita mata, wife of Shri Ram.
Ganesh Chaturthi is a day on which Lord Ganesha, the son of Shiva and Parvati, is believed to bestow his presence on earth for all his devotees. The festival lasts for 10 days, ending on Ananta Chaturdashi. Ganesha, the elephant-headed son of Shiva and Parvati, is widely worshipped as the supreme God of wisdom, prosperity and good fortune.

The beginning of the Islamic new year.
In the early days of Islam, the fasting on the 10th of Ashurah was treated as compulsory. The Holy Prophet preferred the fast of Ashurah to the fast of other days, and the fast of Ramadan to the fast of Ashurah. The fasting on the day of Ashurah is the Sunnah of Holy Prophet and makes one entitled to great reward.
The birth date of Muhammad, the creator of Islam. Mawlid means birthday of a holy figure and an-Nabi means Prophet. The day is commemorated with recollection of Muhammad's life and significance.
The birth date of Muhammad, the creator of Islam. Mawlid means birthday of a holy figure and an-Nabi means Prophet. The day is commemorated with recollection of Muhammad's life and significance.
Ali is respected for his knowledge, belief, honesty, unbending devotion to Islam, deep loyalty to Muhammad, equal treatment of all Muslims and generosity in forgiving his defeated enemies, and therefore is central to mystical traditions in Islam such as Sufism.
Isra refers to the journey of Muhammad from Mecca to a distant mosque in Jerusalem on the back of a heavenly creature called al-buraq. From there He began His journey to the heaven (Miraj) where the Allah gave the orders of 5 times prayer a day, and back to Mecca on the same night. There are no celebrations by Muslims, only the story of Miraj is told to the children via poetry, chants or lectures. Sweets and food are distributed in a festive atmosphere.
When the night of the middle of the Shabaan comes, the Muslims spend the night in prayers and fast the next day so that the Allah forgive their sins.
The first day of the month of the Ramadan. During the blessed month of Ramadan, Muslims all over the world abstain from food, drink, and other physical needs during the daylight hours. As a time to purify the soul, refocus attention on God, and practice self-sacrifice, Ramadan is much more than just not eating and drinking.
Nuzul Al-Qur'an or the commemoration of the revelation of the Holy Quran is one of the highlights of the holy month of Islam. It refers to the revelation of the first verses of the Holy Quran to Prophet Muhammad. The event is meant to teach Muslims to be appreciative and be humbled by the magnificence of the miracle and to take its teachings to heart and to follow its examples in the efforts to lead their lives accordingly.
At the end of Ramadan, Muslims throughout the world observe a joyous three-day celebration called Eid al-Fitr (the festival of Fast-Breaking). It is a time to give in charity to those in need, and celebrate with family and friends the completion of a month of blessings and joy. On the day of Eid, Muslims gather early in the morning in outdoor locations or mosques to perform the Eid prayer. After the Eid prayer, Muslims usually scatter to visit various families and friends and give gifts. 
During the celebration of Eid al-Adha, Muslims commemorate and remember Abraham's trials (he was to kill his own son for Allah), by themselves slaughtering an animal such as a sheep, camel, or goat. One-third of the meat from the sacrifice of Eid al-Adha is eaten by immediate family and relatives, one-third is given away to friends, and one-third is donated to the poor.
The Hajj to Mecca must be carried out at least once in their lifetime by every able-bodied Muslim. As part of the Hajj, each person walks counter-clockwise seven times around the Kaaba, the cube-shaped building which acts as the Muslim direction of prayer (qibla); runs back and forth between the hills of Al-Safa and Al-Marwah; drinks from the Zamzam Well; goes to the plains of Mount Arafat to stand in vigil; and throws stones in a ritual Stoning of the Devil.
A celebration held on the 18th of Dhu al-Hijjah marking the event of Ghadeer Khumm in 10 AH. The day on which God stated the completion of Islam. It is an event celebrated by Shias (and not by Sunni Muslims), and is the basis of their confirmation of Ali ibn Abi Talib's succession to Muhammad.
